## Rules to play

Welcome to Lemming's world!

Your goal is to have at least 60 % of lemmings **IN** the **EXIT** at the bottom.

Click on them to activate their **skills**!

Pssst...! You have all the time in the world, the game will finish only when there are no more lemmings **OUT**...

## To do (priority descending)

- clean code for last commit / clean README.md
- branch master-comments
- final commit
- add lava floor
- umbrella1 (umbrellaOpen)
- umbrella gifs anim a little bit bigger than the other
- use gif v6 for walk left instead of buggy css transform
- fix spawn so it auto corrects its timeout delay based on how low before the alert is discarded (save time before and after)
- fix typo in old commit message
- add hatch dyn positioning is js (instead of manual calc in css)
- in Chrome Dev Tools > Elements > div.walk > img > flex: 1 0 auto; appears (even if not enabled) while commented out in css! weird... (browser cache issue?)
- find better solution to workaround for restart gif anim
- fix `FIX` when needed
- finish to implement player and re-enable it?
- change `%` to `vw`
