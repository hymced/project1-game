# to do (priority descending)

- change % to vw
- add debug mode
- finish to implement player and re-enable it?
- upgrade images version
- add different walk/fall speeds
- fix "FIX" when needed

- LEMMING OUT SCORE + WIN/LOSE + REPLAY
- deploy online using GitHub Pages
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles...

[
- test subpixel rounding vs getBoundingClientRect() subpixel values
- subpixel values from getBoundingClientRect() looks like a conversion using points...
]

- make presentation

questions to ask:
- new spec but impossible to do without refactoring all code, is it normal?
- navigate code by symbols in Chrome Debug Tools > Sources like in GitHub?
- Chrome debugging possible to change variables value live?

Presentation Structure Notes
•	Don’t include a slide just for the technologies.
•	Don’t include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
•	Don’t include a slide for GitHub graphs.
•	Don’t go into detail about how the app works. Your demo is where you want to do that.
•	If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation, feel free to do so. This suggested structure is mostly for people who don’t know what to do.
